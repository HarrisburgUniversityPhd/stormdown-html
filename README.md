# Knit'ing your dissertation

`stormdown` is built on top of [`pagedown`](https://pagedown.rbind.io) which is built on top of [`bookdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown) which is built on top of [`rmarkdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown) which is the R flavor of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).
All the syntax can be found in those resources.
The initial knit of `stormdown` also contains several examples for tables, figures, and flowcharts.
These inline examples can be found in the _/publications/pub(1-3)/paper/results.rmd_ files.

In order to make the initial knit of `stormdown` use the following steps:

1. Navigate to the local folder containing `stormdown`
2. Double-click on _index.rmd_.
   This will open RStudio with the current working directory set to the folder containing _index.rmd_ 
3. Click the blue button labeled "knit"
4. Wait
5. Close RStudio's HTML browser
6. Open _index.html_ in Chrome or Edge.
4. Enjoy

**NOTE**: Some installs of RStudio may be different than others.
If you have a problem with knit'ing, look at the packages found in _/scripts/install_packages.R_.
You may need to install those by manually one at a time
